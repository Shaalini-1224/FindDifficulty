# FindDifficulty
To find difficulty of a question.

Difficulty of a question can be found by testing some parameters of the question such as question type, number of students attented the test, number of students who answered right, wrong and partially right, time taken, number of hints used, languages used, time taken to answer the question, maximum marks and feedback given by the students. By analysing the these parameters we can find difficulty index which will be in the range between 0 and 1. If the difficulty index is less than 0.4 then the question is HARD, if the difficulty index is between 0.4 and 0.6 then the question is MEDIUM and if the difficulty index is greater than 0.6 then the question is EASY. Question type, difficulty level, right answer percentage, wrong answer percentage, average timen, maximum marks, mostly used language is displayed.
I hereby attached the psedocode and some of the input files named as QuestionFile1, QuestionFile2, QuestionFile3, QuestionFile4.
